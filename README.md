# baseline-smoother
Implementation of baseline smoother
of the baseline cleaner from the paper "Efficient and Effective Baseline Correction Algorithm for Raman Spectra" by Yung-Sheng Chen & Yu Hsu. In their paper they apply the algorithm to Raman spectra in chronopgraphy. The algorithm does work for other signals.
