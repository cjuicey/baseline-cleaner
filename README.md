Implementation of the baseline cleaner from the paper "Efficient and Effective Baseline Correction Algorithm for Raman Spectra" by Yung-Sheng Chen & Yu Hsu. In their paper they apply the algorithm to Raman spectra in chronopgraphy. The algorithm does work for other signals. 

Run demo to see what the algorithm does to a spikey curve with an uneven baseline. We consider the baseline a chunk of space under a curve that separates the curve from the axis.
